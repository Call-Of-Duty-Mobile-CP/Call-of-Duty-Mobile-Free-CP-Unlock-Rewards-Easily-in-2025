### How to Unlock Free CP in Call of Duty Mobile in 2025

Let‚Äôs dive into the different ways you can unlock free CP in Call of Duty Mobile. By following these methods, you can start earning rewards right now. Here are the best strategies:

#### 1. **Participate in In-Game Events and Challenges**

One of the easiest ways to unlock free CP in Call of Duty Mobile is by participating in in-game events and completing challenges. Activision frequently hosts limited-time events where players can earn rewards, including CP. These events often include daily or weekly challenges where you need to achieve specific tasks or objectives.

For example, completing a set of missions, winning a certain number of multiplayer matches, or reaching specific milestones in the game can reward you with CP.

- **Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù tab in the game for any special promotions that offer CP as a reward. The more active you are in the game, the more opportunities you‚Äôll have to unlock free CP.

#### 2. **Use Third-Party Reward Apps**

Certain third-party apps allow you to earn CP for free by completing simple tasks. These tasks may include watching videos, answering surveys, or downloading other apps. While this method isn‚Äôt a direct feature of Call of Duty Mobile, it‚Äôs a widely used strategy for earning free in-game currency in many mobile games.

Some trusted apps that reward users for completing offers or engaging in activities include:

- **Mistplay** (for Android devices)
- **FeaturePoints**
- **AppBounty**

Once you collect enough points or rewards in these apps, you can redeem them for COD Points.

- **Caution**: Always check the legitimacy of any third-party app you use. Make sure they are trustworthy and have good reviews from other users before you proceed.

#### 3. **Claim Free CP through Official Promotions**

Activision frequently runs official promotions and giveaways, particularly around new game updates, seasons, or milestones. These promotions sometimes allow players to earn CP by simply logging in during a special event or by completing specific tasks tied to a promotion.

To maximize your chances of unlocking free CP, you should regularly check the official Call of Duty Mobile social media accounts, forums, or the game‚Äôs website for announcements about upcoming promotions.

- **Tip**: Follow Call of Duty Mobile on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for the latest news about free CP offers and giveaways. By staying informed, you can jump on these opportunities as soon as they become available.

#### 4. **Use Promotional Codes**

Another way to unlock free CP is by using promotional codes provided by Activision or their partners. These codes are typically shared through social media platforms, community events, or even special collaborations. Players can redeem these codes for in-game currency, skins, or other rewards.

  - Check Call of Duty Mobile‚Äôs official social media profiles.

In addition to official promotions, many community-driven contests and giveaways provide opportunities to earn free CP in Call of Duty Mobile. These contests are often hosted by popular streamers, YouTubers, or fan communities. Prizes in these contests can include CP, weapon skins, and even exclusive COD Mobile merchandise.

- **Tip**: Join active COD Mobile fan communities on Reddit, Discord, or Facebook groups. These communities often share details about contests, giveaways, and other opportunities for free rewards.

#### 6. **Level Up Your Battle Pass**

While the Battle Pass requires an initial investment of CP, progressing through it will unlock a ton of free rewards, including CP. For players who aren‚Äôt willing to buy the premium pass, the free Battle Pass track still offers several useful items, and certain milestones along the way can reward you with CP.

- **Bonus Tip**: As you level up your Battle Pass, pay attention to the ‚ÄúFree‚Äù track, as it sometimes provides players with small amounts of CP.

#### 7. **Watch Ads for CP**

Some mobile games, including Call of Duty Mobile, offer players the opportunity to watch ads in exchange for small amounts of CP or other rewards. While this method may take some time, it‚Äôs a completely free way to earn CP at your own pace.

- **Where to Find Ads**: Look for the ‚ÄúWatch Ads‚Äù option in the in-game store or event tab. These ads can be a quick way to collect free CP on a regular basis.
